   <h2>Terms and Condition</h2>
  <hr>
  <p><h4>Operating Agreement</h4> <p>This Agreement contains the complete terms and conditions that apply to an individual's or entity's participation in the discount coupan Affiliates Program (the"<strong>Program</strong>"). As used in this Agreement, "<strong>we</strong>","<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>" means discount coupan Internet Private Limited or any of our affiliate; parent; or group companies and our successors and assigns, as the case may be, and "<strong>you</strong>" means the applicant. <strong>discount coupan Site</strong> means, collectively, the discount coupan.com website. "<strong>Your site</strong>" means your website where you will link to the discount coupan Site (and which you will identify in your Program application). Save for our obligation to pay referral fees under Section 4, which may be performed solely by us, we may cause any of our obligations under this Agreement to be fulfilled by any of our Affiliates (defined below), on our behalf.</p> 
   
 Enrollment in the Program <p>You have to be 18 years or above to enroll in this Program. To begin the enrollment process, you will submit a complete Program 
 Application via the discount coupan Site. We will evaluate your application in good 
 faith and will notify you of its acceptance or rejection. We may reject your 
 application if we determine (in our sole discretion) that your site is unsuitable 
 for the Program. Unsuitable sites include, but are not limited to, those 
 that:</p> 
 <p>Advertise affiliate links through pop-up windows / pop-unders</p>
  <p>Advertise affiliate links as a cashback offer</p> 
 <p>Advertise misleading/wrong offers/deals running on discount coupan</p> 
  <p>Use affiliate links, whether directly or indirectly, on web sites offering 
 any kind of referral program with/without payment of fees and/or sites in the 
 nature of multi-level marketing arrangements</p>
  <p>Use affiliate links in HTML emailers, newsletters or any other form of bulk 
 emails</p>
  <p>Use affiliate links on illegal audio/video download sites</p>
  <p>Promote affiliate link via use of paid ads on search engine result 
 pages and social media websites by bidding on trademark of discount coupan.com or any variation or misspelling of any trademark of discount coupan.com</p>
  <p>Promote pornography and sexually explicit materials</p> 
  <p>Promote violence</p> 
  <p>Promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, 
 disability, sexual orientation, or age</p> 
 <p>Promote illegal activities</p> 
 <p>Include any trademark of discount coupan.com, or its affiliates, or any variation 
 or misspelling of any trademark of discount coupan.com, or its affiliates, in any 
 domain name -- for example, a domain name such as "discount coupan.mydomain.com", 
 "discount coupanauctions.net", "facebook.com/discount coupandealsgroup," would be 
 unsuitable</p> 
<p>Include any trademark of discount coupan.com, Inc. or its affiliates in any 
 username, group name, or other identifier on any social networking website</p> 
  <p>Include any colour combination or layout similar or identical to 
 discount coupan.com, with the intention to deceive</p> 
 <p>Use links or URLs which are not published by the discount coupan Site or by discount coupan Affiliate Program.</p> 
<p>Add products directly to the customer's cart using scripts or any tools.</p>  <p>Otherwise violate intellectual property rights.
 <p>
  <p>Please also note that you may not purchase products during sessions initiated 
 through the links on your site for your own use, for resale or commercial use of 
 any kind. This includes orders for customers or on behalf of customers or orders 
 for products to be used by you or your friends, relatives, or associates in any 
 manner. The reason behind this policy is that the discount coupan Affiliate Program is an  advertising program rather than a discount program. Our goal is to have our affiliates refer new customers to us in return for referral fees. Affiliates are not eligible for referral fees when they place orders themselves, or ask people they know to routinely place orders through their affiliate links so they can earn referral fees.</p>

  <p>With respect to our Mobile App install campaigns through discount coupan Affiliate Program, we do a rigorous data check using industry standard parameters for checking the authenticity &amp; quality of app installs through your affiliate id to keep a check on fraudulent / low quality app installs happening through unethical means. Please note that we hold the right to check the quality of installs being served by our affiliates and the right to suspend/disable their affiliate account or withhold payments if we observe any fraudulent stuff happening through your affiliate id. Under such circumstances we hold the right to terminate/disable your affiliate account and/or withhold all pending affiliate commissions with immediate effect without any prior notice.</p> 
  <p>By participating in the Program you agree that you will not engage in any such activities. If we reject your application, you are welcome to reapply to the Program at any time. You should also note that if we accept your application and your site is thereafter determined (in our sole discretion) to be unsuitable for the Program at a later period, we may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect including withholding all your pending commission payments, with or without notice, as may  be determined in sole discretion of discount coupan.com. Participation in the Program is limited to parties that lawfully can enter into and form contracts under applicable law. For example, minors are not allowed to participate in the Program.</p> 
  <p>During the registration process on /affiliate/signup, it is compulsory to provide the information of all "Your Website(s)" in the "Affiliate Website Information" section, which you would be linking to the discount coupan Site. We record your traffic from these websites/blogs and hold the 
 authority to withhold your payments/disable your account in case of:</p> 
 <p>Traffic coming from any website / blogs not mentioned by you in the 
 "Affiliate Website Information" section</p>
  <p>In case of any violations made by the websites / blogs not mentioned in the 
 "Affiliate Website Information" section</p> 
 <p>Further, by participating in the Program you agree that you have read and 
 understood the contents of discount coupan Terms of Use 
 (http://www.discount coupan.com/s/terms) and contents of the said Terms of Use shall be 
 read as part and parcel of the Agreement, wherever applicable and be binding upon 
 you.</p>
 Links on Your Site 
  <p>Once you have been notified that your site has been accepted into the Program, 
 and subject to clause 1 of this Terms and Conditions, we grant you a revocable, 
 non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license for the duration of the term of 
 this Agreement, solely for purposes of facilitating referrals from your site to 
 the discount coupan Site, to provide on your site one or more of the following types of 
 links to the discount coupan Site:</p>  <h5>Product Links:</h5> <p>You may select one or more Products to list on your site using a variety 
 of formats that we make available to you, such as text link format, graphical 
 link format, customizable "widget" format, or "product preview" link format. 
 A "Product" is any product listed on the discount coupan Site that is fulfilled by 
 us or on our behalf, a Digital Product (defined below), or any product sold 
 by a third party seller on the discount coupan Site. For each selected Product, you 
 will display on your site a short description, review, or other reference. 
 You will be responsible for the content, style, and placement of these 
 references. You will provide a Special Link (as defined below) from each 
 Product reference on your site to the corresponding discount coupan Site online 
 catalog entry. Each such link will connect directly to a single item in our 
 online catalog. You may add or delete Products (and related links) from your 
 site at any time without our approval. You may not use Special Links to link 
 to the discount coupan Site from references to products on your site that are not 
 "Products" as defined above.</p><h5>Search Box Link:</h5> <p>You may provide a discount coupan Site search box on your site that will permit 
 your site visitors to view Products that are the results of their search 
 query within the Search Box link or view results that link directly to a page 
 on the discount coupan Site that contains the results of their search query. We will 
 provide you with technical specifications describing how to include an 
 discount coupan Site search box on your site.</p><h5>General Link to discount coupan Site Home Page:</h5> <p>You may provide a general link on your site to the home page of the 
 discount coupan Site.</p> <h5>Search Results Link:</h5> <p>You may provide a link on your site that will link to a particular search 
 result on the discount coupan Site, the parameters of which will be determined by 
 you based on search generating alternatives we make available to you.</p><h5>Any Page Link:</h5> <p>You may provide a link on your site that will link to any particular page 
 on the discount coupan Site, provided that you properly use the special link formats 
 provided on the discount coupan Site as part of the Program to create such link. We 
 will provide you with guidelines and graphical artwork to use in linking to 
 the discount coupan Site home page. To permit accurate tracking, reporting, and 
 referral fee accrual, we will provide you with special "tagged" link formats 
 to be used in all links between your site and the discount coupan Site (and for 
 purposes of this Agreement, the browser window described above that opens 
 upon a user's clicking on a Quick-Click link is deemed a part of the discount coupan 
 Site, and any Quick-Click link is deemed a link between your site and the 
 discount coupan Site). You must ensure that each of the links between your site and 
 the discount coupan Site properly utilizes such special link formats. Links to the 
 discount coupan Site placed on your site pursuant to this Agreement and which 
 properly utilize such special link formats are referred to as "Special 
 Links." You will earn referral fees only with respect to activity on the 
 discount coupan Site occurring directly through Special Links; we will not be liable 
 to you with respect to any failure by you to use Special Links, including to 
 the extent that such failure may result in any reduction of amounts that 
 would otherwise be paid to you pursuant to this Agreement. You acknowledge 
 that, by participating in the Affiliate Program and placing any of the above 
 links within your site, we may receive information from or about visitors to 
 your site or communications between your site and those visitors. Your 
 participation in the Program constitutes your specific and unconditional 
 consent to and authorization for our access to, receipt, storage, use, and 
 disclosure of any and all such information, consistent with the policies and 
 procedures set forth in the Privacy Notice on the discount coupan Site. Except for 
 the license granted under this Section 2, you do not obtain any rights under 
 this Agreement in any intellectual property, including, without limitation, 
 any intellectual property with respect to the Special Links, link formats, 
 technical specifications, guidelines or graphical artwork referenced above, 
 or with respect to the discount coupan.com domain names. You also acknowledge that 
 we (and our corporate affiliates) may crawl or otherwise monitor your site 
 for the purpose of ensuring the quality and reliability of Special Links on 
 your site (for example, to detect links that are broken or non-functional, 
 links to products that are out of stock or otherwise unavailable, etc.). 
 Therefore, you agree that we and our corporate affiliates may take such 
 actions and that you will not seek to block or otherwise interfere with such 
 crawling or monitoring (and that we and our corporate affiliates may use 
 technical means to overcome any methods used on your site to block or 
 interfere with such crawling or monitoring). You also acknowledge that as a 
 participant in the Program, we may from time to time send you email updates 
 about the Program. By participating in the Program, you consent to our 
 sending you these email updates. Further, you acknowledge and agree that you 
 will: (a) not, in connection with this Agreement, display or reference on 
 your site, any trademark or logo of any third party seller on the discount coupan 
 Site; (b) ensure that any "Privacy Information" link or discount coupan trademark 
 (either in logo or text form) that we include in a Special Link is not 
 obscured or altered in any way or made invisible, illegible or indecipherable 
 to visitors of your site; (c) use any data, images, text, or other 
 information obtained by you from us or the discount coupan Site in connection with 
 this Agreement ("Content") only in a lawful manner and only in accordance

 available for your use and (j) not use any Content, including any name or 
 likeness embodied therein, in a manner (e.g., a closely proximate placement 
 to unrelated third party materials) that implies a person's or company's 
 endorsement or sponsorship of, or commercial tie-in or other association 
 with, any product, service, party or cause.</p> 
 Order Processing 
 <p>We will process Product orders placed by customers who follow Special Links 
 from your site to the discount coupan Site. We reserve the right to reject/disapprove orders that 
 do not comply with any requirements that we periodically may establish. We will 
 be responsible for all aspects of order processing and fulfillment. Among other 
 things, we will prepare order forms, process payments, cancellations, and 
 returns, and handle customer service. We will track sales made to customers who 
 purchase Products by using Special Links from your site to the discount coupan Site and 
 will make available to you reports summarizing this sales activity. The form, 
 content, and frequency of the reports may vary from time to time in our 
 discretion.</p> 
 Referral Fees 
  <p>We will pay you (in accordance with Sections 5 and 6 below) referral fees on 
 certain Product sales to third parties. For a Product sale to be eligible to earn 
 a referral fee, the customer must click-through a Special Link on your site to 
 the discount coupan Site and during a single session, add the Product to his or her 
 shopping cart. The session begins when the customer clicks through a Special Link 
 on your site to the discount coupan Site and ends upon the first to occur of the 
 following events:</p><p> 24 hours elapse from the customer's initial click-through, or the customer places an order for a Product, or the customer follows a third party link to the discount coupan Site that is 
 appended with a different affiliate's tag, or The customer follows a link to the discount coupan Site that is appended with discount coupan's email campaign tag   We will only pay referral fees on eligible Products after order, payment, and 
 shipping. To permit accurate tracking, reporting and fee accrual, you must ensure 
 that the Special Links between your site and the discount coupan Site are properly 
 formatted. We will not be liable for paying referral fees on purchases that are 
 not correctly tracked and reported because the links between your site and the 
 discount coupan Site are not properly formatted. We will not, however, pay referral fees 
 on any Products that are added to a customer's Shopping Cart after the customer 
 has reentered the discount coupan Site (other than through a Special Link from your 
 site), as determined by us, even if the customer previously followed a link from 
 your site to the discount coupan Site. In addition, we will not pay referral fees for 
 any purchases made by customers referred to us through Special Links generated or 
 displayed in response to general Internet search queries or keywords. For 
 avoidance of doubt, the Search Box Link, which searches the discount coupan Product 
 catalog, or searches of product databases that include discount coupan Products, such as 
 shopping comparison engines, are still eligible for referral fees. You may not 
 purchase products during sessions initiated through the links on your site for 
 your own use, for resale or commercial use of any kind. This includes orders for 
 customers or on behalf of customers or orders for products to be used by you or 
 your friends, relatives, or associates in any manner. Such purchases may result 
 (in our sole discretion) in the withholding of referral fees and/or the 
 termination of this Agreement. In addition, you may not:</p>
 <p>directly or indirectly offer any person or entity any consideration or 
 incentive (including, without limitation, payment of money (including any 
 rebate), or granting of any discount or other benefit) for using Special Links 
 on your site to access the discount coupan Site (e.g., by implementing any "cashback" 
 program for persons or entities who use Special Links on your site to access 
 the discount coupan Site);read, intercept, record, redirect, interpret, or fill in the contents of

 our relationship with you, or as to the site on which any functions or

 Agreement, post or serve any advertisements or promotional content promoting 
 the discount coupan Site or otherwise around or in conjunction with the display of the 
 discount coupan Site (e.g., through any "framing" technique or technology or pop-up or 
 pop-under windows), or assist, authorize, or encourage any third party to take 
 any such action;attempt to circumvent the referral fee schedule or artificially increase 
 your referral fees (e.g. by intentionally featuring, purchasing or requesting 
 or encouraging any third party to purchase low-price items offered on the 
 discount coupan Site (as determined by us) for the purpose of exceeding any referral 
 fee threshold or by causing any page of the discount coupan Site to open in a 
 customer's browser other than as a result of the customer clicking on a Special 
 Link on your site);attempt to intercept or re-direct (including, without limitation, via 
 user-installed software) traffic from or on, or divert referral fees from, any 
 web site that participates in the Program; or seek to purchase or register any keywords, search terms or other 
 identifiers that include the words "discount coupan," "Flipcart", "Digiflip", "Flyte" 
 or any other trademark of discount coupan Internet Private Limited or its affiliates, 
 or variations or misspellings thereof ("Proprietary Terms") for use in any 
 search engine, portal, sponsored advertising service or other search or 
 referral service.<p>From time to time we may request that you cause any applicable web search

 advertising content in association with search results, assuming the provider of
